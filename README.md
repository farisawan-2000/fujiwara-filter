# Fujiwara Filter

## A Discord bot that takes action against rampant meme variations

---

Is your Discord server's meme channel a mess of low-quality content?

Is your server filled to the brim with people who can't bother cropping out their Reddit or iFunny watermark?

Are you currently in a meme war started by someone who cannot stop posting the same image macro with the same caption featuring the same anime girl?

Then this project is for you!

---

# Setup

```bash
git submodule init
<idk the command after this lol>
```
After getting the anime face detection model, put any images you want to explicitly target in the bannedImages folder.

After adding the bot to your server, run

```bash
python3 bot.py
```

And you should be good to go! Try it out by posting images and seeing how it reacts (currently the bot does not actually ban/kick users, look out here for a specific section on configuring/testing the bot when those features are complete!)

# FAQ

## What inspired this project?

I have been "that guy" on many servers. This is for people like me who can take a joke a lot farther than people are willing to put up with.

## Can I get some bot result images?

Once I figure out how to embed images in this file I'll let you know (not really, but check back sometime!)

## Are you stupid?
